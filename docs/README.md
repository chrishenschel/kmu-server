# Documentation

Reference material for a single-installation deployment. Nothing here is stored in git at runtime—all secrets and data stay on the server.

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [DNS-AND-PORTS.md](DNS-AND-PORTS.md) | DNS records and firewall ports to open. |
| [ENV-REFERENCE.md](ENV-REFERENCE.md) | All environment variables (`.env`, Jitsi, etc.). |
| [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) | Day-to-day: start/stop, logs, add user, admin URLs, common tasks. |
| [UPDATING.md](UPDATING.md) | How to pull repo updates and apply them without losing data. |

See also the main [README](../README.md) for installation, architecture, backup/restore, and troubleshooting.
